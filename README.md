# TensorFlow Probability Distributions
- In this project, I explored how to use TensorFlow Probability (TFP) distributions to work with probabilistic models.
- You can get the code in [tensorflow_distributions.ipynb](./tensorflow_distributions.ipynb)

## Distributions in TensorFlow Probability
- Implemented common distributions such as Normal, Bernoulli, and Categorical using TFP.
- Visualized distribution functions, including probability density functions (PDFs) and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs).
- Demonstrated how to sample from these distributions and compute log-likelihoods.

## Joint Distributions and Sampling
- Explored how to model joint distributions using TFP's `JointDistribution` API.
- Performed sampling and visualization of multiple random variables to analyze their behavior.

## Setup
- Create virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
- Activate virtual environment: `call venv/Scripts/activate.bat` in cmd
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Libraries
- TensorFlow Probability
- TensorFlow
- Numpy
